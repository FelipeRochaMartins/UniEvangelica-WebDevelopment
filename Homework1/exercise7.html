    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.
    Even though this text is on a new line in the HTML,
    it will appear on the same line in the browser.</p>

    <p>This is a new paragraph.<br>
    This text will appear on a new line because of the br tag.<br>
    And this will be on another new line.</p>

    <p>Multiple                spaces              between
    words will be treated as a single space by the browser.</p>

    <pre>
    In a pre tag,
        white space    and
            line breaks
    are preserved.
